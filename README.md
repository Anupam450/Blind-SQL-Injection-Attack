# Blind-SQL-Injection-Attack

This project relates about the concept of Blind SQL Injection attack, how it can be performed and security measures to be safe from such attacks. I made this project (being the Team leader) along with my 2 friends- Ritesh Raman and Aditya Vikram Raj; under the guidance of Mr. Soumya Raha (under Ardent Collaborations.)
